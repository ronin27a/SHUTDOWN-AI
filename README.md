â€ºIntroduction
Getting Started with Plugins
Plugins can extend Selenium IDE's default behavior, through adding additional commands and locators, bootstrapping setup before and after test runs, and affecting the recording process.

Selenium IDE is using the WebExtension standard to work in modern browsers (to learn more, you can check out Mozilla's Your first extension article). Communicating between the extensions is handled via the external messaging protocol, you can view an example of that here.

This article assumes knowledge in WebExtension development, and will only discuss Selenium IDE specific capabilities.

Calling the API
Selenium IDE API can be called using browser.runtime.sendMessage.

An example signature would be browser.runtime.sendMessage(SIDE_ID, request) where SIDE_ID refers to the IDE's official extension IDs, which can be viewed here.

Request
The request is the second argument for browser.runtime.sendMessage and is similar in it's ideas to HTTP.

{
  uri: "/register",
  verb: "post",
  payload: {
    name: "Selenium IDE plugin",
    version: "1.0.0"
  }
}
uri - a resource locator to an IDE feature (e.g. record a command, resolve a locator)
verb - a modifier function (e.g. get gets you stuff, post adds new stuff, just like in http)
The IDE will reply with a valid response, or in case of an error, this can be viewed by opening the DevTools of the IDE window.

browser.runtime.sendMessage(SIDE_ID, request).then(response => {
  console.log("it worked!");
});
The Manifest
Plugins provide the IDE with a manifest that declares their changes and additions to the IDE's capabilities.

{
  name: "New Plugin",
  version: "1.0.0",
  commands: [
    {
      id: "newCommand",
      name: "new command",
      type: "locator",
      docs: {
        description: "command description",
        target: { name: "command target", value: "command target description" },
        value: { name: "command value", value: "command value description" }
      }
    },
    {
      id: "anotherCommand",
      name: "another command",
      type: "locator",
      docs: {
        description: "another command description",
        target: "locator",
        value: "pattern"
      }
    }
  ],
  locators: [
    {
      id: "locator"
    }
  ],
  dependencies: {
    "selenium-webdriver": "3.6.0"
  }
}
